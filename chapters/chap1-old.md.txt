<exercise id="2" title="`data.frame` review">

Run `colnames()` and `head()` on the `gap1992` data to see what's in each column. Then see how many rows there are in the dataset using `nrow()`. Run these in console before you submit your answer.

This is a hint.

<exercise id="3" title="Thinking about aesthetics">

Now that we've learned a little about the `data.frame` called `gap1992`, we can get to the fun part: making graphs.

The first thing we are going to is think about how we represent variables in a plot. 

How do we visually represent a variable in our dataset? Take a look at this graph. What variable is mapped to `y`, and what is mapped to `x`, and what is mapped to `color`?

<choice>
<opt text="`x = gdpPercap, y = log(lifeExp), color = continent`">
You have things reversed, and you're taking the log of the wrong variable.
</opt>

<opt text="`x = continent, y = year, color = pop`">
Wrong variables. Go back and look at what's being mapped
</opt>

<opt text="`y = lifeExp, x = log(gdpPercap), color = continent`" correct="true">
We are displaying lifeExp as our y variable and log(gdpPercap) as our x variable.
</opt>
</choice>
